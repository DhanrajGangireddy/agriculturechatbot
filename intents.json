                  "Drought-resistant crops suitable for arid regions may include millet, sorghum, quinoa, and certain varieties of legumes and oilseeds. These crops have adapted to low-water conditions and can thrive in challenging environments.",
                  "Crops offering good returns on investment for small-scale farmers may include high-value vegetables, herbs, and fruits, as well as specialty crops for niche markets. Consider factors such as production costs, market prices, and yield potential when selecting crops.",
                  "Crops requiring minimal water and maintenance may include succulents, native drought-tolerant plants, and perennial crops like berries and fruit trees. These crops conserve water and require less intensive management, making them suitable for low-input farming.",
                  "Best cover crops for soil conservation and improvement include legumes like clover and vetch, grasses such as rye and barley, and brassicas like radishes and mustard. These crops add organic matter, fix nitrogen, and suppress weeds, enhancing soil health.",
                  "Suitable crops for intercropping or companion planting include legumes for nitrogen fixation, aromatic herbs for pest control, and tall crops for shade and wind protection. Companion planting enhances biodiversity, maximizes space utilization, and improves crop resilience.",
                  "Choosing the right crop rotation sequence involves balancing factors such as nutrient requirements, pest and disease management, and soil health goals. Rotating crops with different root structures, growth habits, and nutrient demands can help break pest and disease cycles and maintain soil fertility."]
